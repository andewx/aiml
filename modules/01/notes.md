## Unit 01 Variables
### Types of Variables
- Qualitative Variables (Categorical)
- Quantitative Variables (Numerical)
- Discrete Variables (Event Based/Countable)
- Continuous Variables (Quantitative Variables with infinite values)

### Data Ordering
- Nominal - Qualitative with no ordering of the data. (Male/Female)
- Ordinal - Classifies data into categories which can be ranked but not precise
- Interval - Differences between variables define the variable. Zero not meaningful
- Ratio - Interval variable with a true zero defines ration level of measurement

## Unit 02 Probability Concepts and Random Experiments
### Definition of Probability
- Frequentist Interpretation - Repeated measurement defines event probability
- Bayesian Interpretation - Probability is quantified by the amount of uncertainty about an event

### Advantages of Bayesian
- 50% Uncertainty between two events defines a complete uncertainty between two events
- Quantify uncertainty about events

### Probability Experiments
- Sample Space - Set of possible outcomes of an event
- Outcome - Result of a single trial
- Probability Experiment - Experiment for which the outcome cannot be predicted with certainty
- Event - can represent a subset of possible outcomes (even/odd), or multiple outcomes.
- Simple event - represents a single outcome.

> According to classical probability sample spaces can be used to determine the numerical probability that an event will happen.

> Classical probability assumes the all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely to occur independently of one another.

- Complementary Events - The set of outcomes in the sample space that were not present for a particular event "E".
